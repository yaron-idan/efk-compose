{"message": "that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n"}
{"message": "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n"}
{"message": "doorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!\n"}

{"message": "it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like\n"}
{"message": "telescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly\n"}
{"message": "was not here before,\" said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the\n"}
{"message": "bottle was a paper label, with the words \"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed\n"}
{"message": "on it in large letters.\n"}
{"message": "\"No, I'll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_'\n"}
